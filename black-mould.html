  <h3>Black Mould</h3>

  <h3>What Is It?</h3>
  <p>Black mould is a general term for various types of fungi that grow and proliferate in damp conditions. Think of black mould as a type of plant that needs water to thrive and that can live on just about any surface, from walls to furniture.</p>

  <h3>Is black mould always black?</h3>
  <p>No, it can be dark green and various shades of grey.</p>

</div>
  <h3>How does black mould cause health issues?</h3>
  <p>Black mould releases spores into the air (think of spores as very tiny mould seeds). Spores are so tiny they can't be seen by the naked human eye. Mould spores are found just about everywhere and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. When these spores are inhaled or touched by humans, they can cause an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Moulds also produce microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs), which create an unpleasant “mouldy” or musty smell.</p>

  <h3>What causes mould to grow?</h3>
  <p>When a spore lands on a moist or wet surface, it starts to grow. Like most plants, mould needs a source of moisture to thrive — in fact, moisture is the most important factor for mould to grow.</p>
  <p>Mould also needs oxygen (it won't grow underwater) and a source of food. Mould is not fussy — it can feed on anything that contains carbon. Mould can break down materials such as wood, plasterboard, wallpaper paste, fabrics, and even dust.</p>

</div>
  <h3>Where does the moisture come from?</h3>
  <p>Moisture comes from air that condenses on surfaces (called condensation) or from leaks in pipes, roofs, or flooding (called free water).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Condensation comes from inside — warm, moist air meeting cold surfaces.</li>
    <li>Free water comes from outside — leaks or broken systems letting water in where it shouldn’t be.</li>
  </ul>
<div class="image-block">
  <figure aria-label="Example of severe condensation on a window">
    <img src="condensationwindow.jpeg" alt="condensation on window">

  </figure>
</div>
  <p>Water leaks are usually straightforward to fix once discovered — a competent plumber or roofer can usually solve the problem. </p>

  <p>Condensation, however, can be easy to see and feel (look for water droplets or feel for moisture on surfaces). Preventing condensation over the long term can be challenging.</p>

  <h3>What is condensation?</h3>
  <p>Condensation is water droplets that have formed on surfaces from moisture in the surrounding air when the air cannot hold the moisture in an airborne form any longer.</p>
  <p>The point where the surrounding air cannot hold its moisture any longer and water droplets form is reached when either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More moisture is added to air that cannot escape with the moisture-rich air then coming into contact with a surface (for example: steam from a boiling kettle hitting the underside of a kitchen unit).</li>
    <li>Moist air encounters a cold surface and cools, releasing moisture (for example: a cold drink on a hot day — water droplets form on the outside of the glass).</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>What adds moisture to the air?</h3>
    <p>Moisture is produced by day-to-day activities including cooking, bathing, showering, laundry and even breathing.</p>
  
<h3>How much moisture is added to the air?</h3>
  <p>An average family produces around 35 litres of moisture from daily laundry and bathing activities. This equates to over 1,000 litres a month.</p>
  <div class="image-block">
  <figure aria-label="image showing how much moisture is added to the air">

  </figure>
</div>
  <p>The number of occupants in a property will influence the amount of moisture produced. In addition, different life stages also impact moisture levels — for example, teenage daughters often take longer showers and families with sporty children often generate more laundry than retired couples for example.</p>
    
  <h3>How do we reduce condensation?</h3>
  <p>The three key factors to manage condensation in a property (and thus prevent mould growth) are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Moisture production</li>
    <li>Ventilation</li>
    <li>Heating</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Managing these factors requires a holistic approach as all the factors are interlinked.</p>

  <h3>Moisture production</h3>
  
  <p>The number of occupants in a property will influence the amount of moisture produced. Different life stages also impact moisture levels — for example, teenage daughters often take longer showers and families with sporty children often generate more laundry than retired couples for example.</p>
<p>How can we reduce the amount of moisture produced? It can be practically difficult to materially reduce the amount of moisture produced by families so we typically focus on ventilation and heating instead.</p>
  <h3>Ventilation</h3>
  <p>Good ventilation lets warm, moist air escape and allows fresh, drier air from outside to enter. The inflow of fresh air dilutes airborne moisture inside the property.</p>
  <p>Ventilation can be active (like an extraction fan) or passive (like an air vent).</p>
  <p>The level and type of ventilation required must change in line with any changes in moisture production or the fabric of the property — even small changes matter. For example, installing triple glazing, new doors, windows, or insulation can all affect airflow. It is imperative that any ventilation systems are regularly cleaned and maintained.</p>

  <h3>Heating</h3>
  <p>Keeping the property at a steady, comfortable temperature reduces cold surfaces where condensation can form. If heating is turned on and off sharply, or only a few rooms are heated, the fabric of the building does not warm up consistently. Cold spots form and unheated areas become condensation magnets, creating the perfect environment for mould growth.</p>
