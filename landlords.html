  <h3>Landlords</h3>

  <h3>A Practical, Professional Approach for Eradicating and Managing the Risk of Black Mould in Domestic Properties</h3>

  <h3>Landlords' Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>Landlords have a legal responsibility to resolve mould issues caused by structural faults. Tenants are required to act in a “tenant-like manner” and prevent damp and moisture build-up by ventilating properties.</p>

  <p>While roles and responsibilities seem straightforward on paper, in reality, pinpointing the sources of black mould can be extremely tricky and time-consuming for landlords when disputes arise.</p>

  <h3>Black Mould Risk</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial risk — significant damages payable to tenants, legal fees, and cost of remedial works</li>
    <li>Operational risk — time, effort, and cost involved in:
      <ol>
        <li>Defending against tenant claims</li>
        <li>Proving tenant responsibility</li>
        <li>Claiming compensation for tenant-caused mould</li>
        <li>Managing contractors and remedial works</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Lost rental income</li>
    <li>Reputational damage and bad publicity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Upcoming Legislation Changes</h3>
  <h4>Awaab's Law</h4>
  <p>Landlords in the UK face increasing legal and financial risks related to black mould. Awaab's Law, taking effect in October 2025, will introduce strict timeframes for social landlords to fix damp and mould issues, with penalties for non-compliance.</p>
  <p>While it initially targets social housing, similar requirements are expected for private landlords in the near future.</p>

  <h3>Managing Black Mould Risk</h3>
  <p>Prevention is far better than cure. Unmanaged black mould almost always leads to extra costs, lost time, and frustrated landlords and tenants alike.</p>

  <h4>Rising or Penetrating Damp</h4>
  <p>When black mould is caused by rising or penetrating damp, the source is usually localised and clearly evident — and tenants are not the cause. In these cases, landlords have clear responsibility for remedial works.</p>
  <p>Remedies include hiring competent roofers for leaks, plumbers for pipe issues, and professional damp surveyors for persistent rising or penetrating damp.</p>

  <h4>Black Mould Caused by Tenants</h4>
  <p>Proving tenant responsibility can be tedious and tricky. Establishing the cost of damage and recovering compensation for remedial works and professional fees can be time-consuming — and success is not guaranteed.</p>

  <h4>Ventilation Shortcomings</h4>
  <p>Identifying and fixing isolated issues often fails to solve black mould long-term. A lack of in-depth knowledge among landlords, agents, and contractors — plus a lack of a holistic, managed approach — can lead to a costly cycle of recurring mould problems.</p>

  <h3>Long-Term, Holistic Solutions</h3>

    <figcaption>A long term holistic approach means cost savings and happy tenants </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
  <h4>Adequate Ventilation Over Time</h4>
  <p>“Adequate ventilation over time” should be the focus. This means systems must stand up to real-world conditions and changing occupancy levels over their useful life.</p>

  <h4>A Change of Mindset</h4>
  <p>Landlords must move beyond quick-fix solutions (like simply painting over mould) and instead adopt a long-term, holistic approach to domestic ventilation. We recommend planning over a 5-year period at minimum.</p>

  <h4>Best Practice for a Holistic Approach</h4>
  <p>A landlord’s long-term ventilation strategy should include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Systems designed for at least a 5-year useful life</li>
    <li>Installation and upgrades controlled, inspected, and signed off by a qualified third party</li>
    <li>Documented cleaning and operating procedures for tenants</li>
    <li>Regular third-party inspections, maintenance, and repairs</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Domestic Ventilation Design Considerations</h4>
  <p>Systems must expel moist air within acceptable timeframes, adapting to real-world conditions and changes in occupancy over their lifetime.</p>

  <h3>“Real-World Conditions” — The Key Term</h3>

  <h4>Occupancy Considerations</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Tenants may not use active ventilation properly or at all</li>
    <li>Daily airing-out routines might be skipped</li>
    <li>Tenants may block passive vents or disable fans to reduce energy bills</li>
    <li>Occupancy levels and occupants' ages naturally change over time</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Structural Element Considerations</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Advertised vs. installed capacity — many systems underperform in practice</li>
    <li>Use quality components and fans — avoid cheap, off-the-shelf options</li>
    <li>Design ducting routes with minimal bends and turns; avoid flexible ducting where possible</li>
    <li>Use rigid, insulated ducting in cold spaces</li>
    <li>Use automated systems wherever possible</li>
    <li>Integrate run-time data capture functions</li>
    <li>Ensure systems are easy to inspect and maintain — avoid hidden or glued-in components</li>
    <li>Use third-party sign-off during design and installation</li>
    <li>Locate fans close to exterior walls to shorten ducting routes</li>
    <li>Plan for seasonal occupancy changes — for example, holiday guests in winter</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Ventilation is a Specialist Field</h4>
  <p>Effective damp and mould management requires up-to-date technical knowledge and hands-on experience. Best practice is to hire a qualified domestic ventilation professional to plan, organise, lead, and control every stage — from initial assessment to design, installation, testing, sign-off, and maintenance.</p>

  <p>Landlords who work with domestic ventilation professionals will benefit from fewer headaches, cost savings, and better operational efficiency in the long run.</p>
