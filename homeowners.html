  <h3>Causes of Black Mould</h3>

  <h4>Leaks, Rising and Penetrating Damp</h4>
  <p>These cases are less common than condensation related black mould. Roof and pipe leaks typically require competent trades such as roofers and plumbers. Penetrating or rising damp would need an appropriately qualified damp surveyor and contractor.</p>
<h4>Inadequate Ventilation and Poor Heating Regimes</h4>
  <p>Black mould is most commonly the result of inadeqaute or poorly maintained ventilation or a poor heating regime</p>

</div>
  <h3>Ventilation: The Major Factor</h3>
  <p>The majority of black mould issues in homes are caused by inadequate ventilation. Adequate ventilation removes excess airborne moisture before it condenses on surfaces.</p>

  <h3>Types of Domestic Ventilation</h3>

  <h4>Active Ventilation</h4>
  <p>Active ventilation uses mechanical systems (like extractor fans, whole-house units, or heat recovery systems) to move air in and out — regardless of natural airflow or weather.</p>

  <h4>Passive Ventilation</h4>
  <p>Passive ventilation relies on natural forces like wind and temperature differences. Air enters and exits through trickle vents, air bricks, or open windows.</p>

  <h3>Primary Sources of Ventilation Issues</h3>
   <h4>Occupant Habits</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Failure to use ventilation correctly or at all.</li>
    <li>Lack of effective routines to air out the home.</li>
    <li>Poor maintenance of ventilation systems — often hidden in lofts or boxed-in ducting.</li>
    <li>Changes in occupancy — more people = more moisture.</li>
    <li>Blocking vents to reduce energy bills.</li>
  </ol>
<div class="image-block">
  <figure aria-label="image of clogged ducting">
    <img src="photos/Clogged-dryer-vent-cover.jpg" alt="image of clogged ducting">
    <figcaption>Clogged or dirty ducting reduces airflow and increases the risk of black mould</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
  <h4>Structural Elements</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Cheap, off-the-shelf fans that don’t match installed capacity needs.</li>
    <li>Poorly designed or retrofitted systems with no formal design plan.</li>
    <li>Excessive use of flexible ducting and no upsizing for extra bends or length.</li>
    <li>Property changes — like adding a power shower without upgraded extraction.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It can be tricky to tell the difference between poor occupant habits and structural issues. But both are crucial to address.</p>

  <h3>Root Cause: Lack of Knowledge and a Fragmented Approach to Ventilation</h3>
  <p>The real root cause of black mould is a lack of in-depth knowledge underpinned by the lack of a holistic, managed approach to managing internally generated moisture. Solving individual mould spots or single aspects of the complex puzzle rarely works long-term. Good system design, controlled and documented installation, regular maintenance and good homeowner habits are prerequisites to living mould free.</p>

  <h3>Long-Term Sustainable Prevention</h3>
  <p>“Adequate ventilation over time” is key. Ventilation must stand up to changing real-world conditions over the useful of the system components.</p>

  <h4>Change of Mindset Required</h4>
  <p>Rather than quick fixes like swapping an extractor fan, homeowners should think long-term. Best practice: take a 5-year view, combining system design, daily habits, and professional maintenance.</p>

  <h4>Best Practice Includes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Proper system design and installation.</li>
    <li>Good homeowner habits and cleaning.</li>
    <li>Annual inspection and maintenance by a professional.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>System Design</h4>
  <p>Design must ensure the volume of moist air produced is expelled quickly enough under real conditions — with capacity for changes in occupancy.</p>

  <h4>Homeowner Habits</h4>
  <p>Good daily habits keep vents and fans working properly. But structural fixes often need professional help.</p>

  <h4>Knowledge: The Critical Issues for Homeowners</h4>
  <p>How would a homeowner know for example, if their bathroom fan isn’t extracting air fast enough for the size of the bathroom or number of occupants? Or, if their property has a sufficient number of passive air vents installed?
</p>

  <h4>Questions Homeowners Should Be Asking</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Who should homeowners consult — electricians, plumbers, handymen?</li>
    <li>How would homeowners check that contractors have installed to the required standards?</li>
    <li>How would upgrades to ventilation meet future needs?</li>
    <li>How would capacity and performance of active ventilation be signed off as sufficient?.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best Practice: Engage a Domestic Ventilation Professional</h3>
  <p>Engaging a qualified professional (e.g., PCA) is the most cost effective, practical approach to solving black mould for the long term. A professional should:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Assess the system holistically.</li>
    <li>Ensure current standards are met.</li>
    <li>Check components are fit for purpose.</li>
    <li>Future-proof the system.</li>
    <li>Manage and verify installations.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Managing Trades & Contractors</h3>
  <p>Condensation and mould problems often appear long after a contractor is paid and gone. Homeowners should therefore:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ask for and check credentials — e.g., NICEIC electricians should have Domestic Ventilation Certificates.</li>
    <li>Beware of contractors who cannot demonstrate knowledge of current standards — CPD matters.</li>
    <li>Ensure quotes reference current standards.</li>
    <li>Request clear specifications for fans, ducting, connectors, etc.</li>
    <li>Require easy access to systems for cleaning and inspection — no boxing-in.</li>
    <li>Get photo graphic evidence and sign-off before ducting is covered.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Treating Black Mould</h3>
  <p>Clean small patches of visible mould with over-the-counter products (wear gloves and a mask). The source of moisture MUST be addressed inline with any cleaning regime. A qualified damp surveyor should assess and provide a long term sustainable solution. Ideally, a mould removal company should not be engaged to clean the mould until the underlying cause has been indentified and remedied.</p>

  <h4>Mould Resistant Paint</h4>
  <p>Mould resistant paint doesn’t prevent mould by itself — it only works as part of a wider moisture control strategy. It helps limit regrowth for a while but:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Doesn’t solve root causes.</li>
    <li>Mould may hide behind paint.</li>
    <li>Has a limited lifespan.</li>
    <li>May be costly and not suit all surfaces.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Best Daily & Regular Practices for Homeowners</h3>

  <h4>Cooking</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use cooker hood fans and run them for at least 7 minutes after cooking.</li>
    <li>Open kitchen windows to vent moist air.</li>
    <li>Keep filters and vents clean.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Laundry</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use condenser/heat pump dryers — empty tanks, clean filters, or pipe to drain if possible.</li>
    <li>Close doors, open windows when drying laundry.</li>
    <li>Use a laundry rack in the bathroom if no dryer is available.</li>
    <li>Never dry clothes on radiators.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Bathing & Showering</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use extraction fans when bathing. Open windows to let moist air out.</li>
    <li>Wipe surfaces dry after use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Air & Trickle Vents</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep all vents clean and clear. Open windows daily, even in winter.</li>
    <li>Air out cupboards and wardrobes regularly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Heating</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a consistent temperature — ideally 18–20&deg;C, even when away.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Gutters</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep gutters clear to prevent leaks and overspill.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Furniture</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Leave space behind furniture, especially on external walls — at least 10 cm gap.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Issues</h3>

  <h4>Active Ventilation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheap fans that aren’t fit for purpose.</li>
    <li>Filters and vents not cleaned properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Installed vs Advertised Capacity</h4>
  <p>Real-world installed capacity is always less than lab-tested advertised capacity. Factor in wear and tear and real conditions.</p>

  <h4>Flexible Ducting</h4>
  <p>Keep flexible ducting under 30 cm — use rigid wherever possible.</p>

  <h4>Insulated Ducting</h4>
  <p>In cold spaces, insulate ducting so warm moist air doesn’t condense inside it.</p>

  <h4>Ducting Routes</h4>
  <p>Avoid unnecessary twists and turns. Each bend reduces efficiency and adds friction. Always vent to the exterior — not into lofts or cavities!</p>

    <figcaption>Poorly installed ducting reduces efficiency and shortens the life of fans and extractors</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
  <h4>Incorrect Duct Sizing</h4>
  <p>Too small = poor flow, back pressure, higher costs. Too big = poor velocity. Get sizing right for quiet, effective systems.</p>

  <h4>Lack of Ducting</h4>
  <p>Venting straight into a loft or cavity is a recipe for hidden mould. Always expel moist air outdoors.</p>

  <h3>Improving Ventilation</h3>

  <h4>Passive Ventilation</h4>
  <p>Calculate vent sizes properly. Wall vents should be near the top of external walls with a slight upward angle to drain condensation outward.</p>

  <h4>Trickle Vents</h4>
  <p>Install on all external windows. Use acoustic versions for road-facing rooms.</p>

  <h4>Active Ventilation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use high-quality fans and rigid ducting.</li>
    <li>Always insulate ducting in cold spaces.</li>
    <li>Limit flexible ducting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Use Automation & Run-Time</h4>
  <p>Fit humidistat functions and connect fans to bathroom lights so they run automatically. Ensure fans run for at least 10 minutes after use.</p>

  <h4>Future-Proof Ventilation</h4>
  <p>Compare installed capacity to real needs, considering future occupancy. When in doubt, give us a call.</p>

  <h4>Ventilate at Source</h4>
  <p>Locate fans as close to external walls as possible — less duct length means better performance.</p>
