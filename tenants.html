  <h3>Tenants</h3>

  <h3>Legal Responsibility To Prevent Mould Growth</h3>
  <p>Tenants play a pivotal role in preventing mould growth through their daily habits and cleaning routines. They may be legally liable for damages if they have not acted reasonably to prevent mould growth.</p>

  <h3>Tenants must use the provided ventilation and heating systems to: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ventilate the property effectively</li>
    <li>Ensure a consistent heating regime is maintained</li>
    <li>Air out the property regularly — for example, open bedroom windows for 10–15 minutes each morning</li>
    <li>Wipe away any condensation</li>
    <li>Promptly clean patches of mould that may occur (use rubber gloves and a face mask)</li>
    <li>Inform the landlord if mould reappears after cleaning or appears elsewhere</li>
    <li>Inform the landlord if extraction, heating, or ventilation is not working properly</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Practical Guidance for Tenants</h3>

  <h3>Cooking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use cooker hood extraction fans when cooking and open kitchen windows to let moisture escape</li>
    <li>Clean extractor hood filters regularly</li>
    <li>Open windows when using air fryers and ovens</li>
    <li>Cover pans and pots when cooking</li>
    <li>Wipe up any moisture that forms on surfaces</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Laundry</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the condensing dryer (if provided) and empty condensed water regularly</li>
    <li>Clean dryer filters regularly</li>
    <li>Close internal doors when using the dryer</li>
    <li>Best practice: use a laundry rack in the bathroom if no dryer is present</li>
    <li>Keep bathroom doors closed and windows open when drying laundry</li>
    <li>Wipe up any moisture that forms on surfaces</li>
    <li>Avoid drying clothes on radiators</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bathroom</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the extraction fan when bathing or showering and open the bathroom window</li>
    <li>Wipe up any moisture that forms on surfaces</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Air Vents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep air vents (brick, trickle, or other) clean and free of blockages</li>
    <li>Open windows every morning (even in winter) to air out the property</li>
    <li>Air out cupboards and wardrobes regularly</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Heating</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a constant heating regime</li>
    <li>Do not switch heating off completely when leaving for work — maintain 18–20°C consistently</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Gutters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep gutters clean to prevent overspill and leaks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Internal Doors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Close internal doors when cooking, showering/bathing, or doing laundry</li>
    <li>This helps contain moisture-laden air instead of letting it spread throughout the property</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Furniture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Leave space behind furniture, especially against external walls — at least a 10 cm gap for airflow</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tenants Should Never:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Block any vents (sometimes done to reduce heating costs)</li>
    <li>Disable extraction fans (sometimes done to save electricity)</li>
    <li>Paint over mould</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deposit, Rent, and Compensation FAQs</h3>

  <h3>Is Mould Considered Normal Wear and Tear?</h3>
  <p>It depends on the cause. If mould is caused by tenant negligence and the landlord has provided advice and regular maintenance, then compensation can be claimed.</p>

  <h3>Can a Landlord Deduct a Deposit for Mould?</h3>
  <p>If mould was not present at the start of a tenancy but appears due to tenant actions and is beyond ‘fair wear and tear’, landlords can deduct money from the deposit.</p>

  <h3>Can Tenants Withhold Rent for Mould?</h3>
  <p>If the landlord won’t make necessary repairs, tenants should still pay rent. Withholding rent could lead to repossession or eviction.</p>

  <h3>Can I End My Tenancy Early Due to Mould?</h3>
  <p>You must end your tenancy correctly if you decide to move out. Otherwise, you may still have to pay rent after leaving. Check your tenancy agreement for an early break clause.</p>

  <h3>Can Tenants Claim Compensation for Mould and Damp?</h3>
  <p>Tenants can claim compensation if damp or mould affected your health, caused expense, or damaged belongings. You can also claim if the property was unfit for habitation.</p>

  <h3>Landlord’s Responsibilities (When It Comes to Damp and Mould)</h3>
  <p>Landlords are responsible for structural elements and ensuring proper heating, insulation, and ventilation. They should always investigate thoroughly and not simply say damp and mould are your responsibility.</p>

  <h3>Your Landlord Must Fix Structural Failings That Can Cause Damp and Mould</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Faulty pipes</li>
    <li>Leaking roofs</li>
    <li>Broken gutters</li>
    <li>Damaged brickwork</li>
    <li>Broken extractor fans</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They are also responsible for dealing with rising damp if the damp-proof course does not work or if the property is unsafe. Rising damp happens when water from the ground soaks up into walls. Fixing this can be complex and time-consuming.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Damp and mould are practically a shared responsibility between tenant and landlord. The tenant is responsible for daily activities that can cause damp and mould, while the landlord is responsible for the building’s structure and ensuring proper heating, ventilation, and insulation. Proving responsibility can be tricky, so it’s best practice to work with your landlord or their agents to manage and solve any mould problems collectively.</p>
